# SpotWire Service

## Synopsis

The SpotWire is a platform designed to streamline the process of creating, managing, and approving advertising campaigns. It enables users to register themselves and their companies, submit ad proposals, collaborate with agencies and channels, and track proposal status updates in real time. The system ensures seamless workflow by allowing editors to manage client and campaign data, while users can receive notifications, review past proposals, and approve final campaign edits before execution.
